# Maximum-Even-Sum

## Given an array, return the maximum even sum of the elements of the array.

### Steps to follow to solve this problem
- find the sum of all the elements in the array, lets call it **totalSum**
- then find the smallest odd element in the array , lets call it **minOdd**
- at last **subtract the smallest odd number** from the total sum
- then return the **totalSum**
